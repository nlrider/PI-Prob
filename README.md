# PI Prob: Comparing an Expert System to Classic ML Model Performance
How classic ML models stack up to PI Prob performance. 
Claims and SDOH data were used to train and validate an SVM, Naive Bayes' Classifier and Logistic Regression Classifier.  The identical 150 patient dataset described in https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237285 was used to assess performance of the above ML models compared to the custom, expert-Bayesian Network system.
